## Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to Plinio, my personal assistant project. Plinio is here to help me (and maybe you) organize daily life. Whether it's managing tasks, setting reminders, or fetching information, Plinio leverages the power of a large language model to make things easier.   
This is a work in progress.


## Configuration

You can connect Plinio to different APIs and services. Update the `.env` file with your settings:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
```

Check out the documentation for each service to get the necessary API keys and configure any additional settings.

## Contributing

If you'd like to help improve Plinio, here's how you can contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Make your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a pull request.

Let's make Plinio even better together!
